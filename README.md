### Projects

- [Tails Together](https://github.com/nqkii/TailsTogether)
  My first academic work is a significant group project where my team was tasked with developing a complete game. I was the lead gameplay programmer for this project, taking responsibility for implementing key game mechanics   and logic. Our collaborative effort was highly successful, resulting in a score of 95 out of 100, and secured us a shared second place ranking among 20 competing teams. This achievement highlights my ability to not only      deliver high-quality code but also to work effectively in a team environment.
